      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Prep:</strong> Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C).</li>
        <li><strong>Mix Dry:</strong> Whisk flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar in a large bowl.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut in Butter:</strong> Add cold butter to the flour. Use a pastry cutter or fork to work it in until it looks like coarse crumbs with pea-sized bits.</li>
        <li><strong>Add Liquid:</strong> Make a well in the center and pour in the buttermilk. Stir gently with a spoon until a shaggy dough forms.</li>
        <li><strong>Fold for Layers:</strong> Turn dough onto a floured surface. Pat into a rectangle, fold in thirds like a letter, and repeat 2–3 times to create flaky layers.</li>
        <li><strong>Cut & Bake:</strong> Cut rounds with a biscuit cutter (press straight down, do not twist). Place on a baking sheet and bake for 12–15 minutes until golden brown. </li>
      </ol>
